Project Title
Image-Based Steganography: Secure Message Encoding and Decoding

Overview
This project implements image-based steganography to securely hide secret messages inside images. The messages are embedded within the pixel values, making them invisible to human eyes. A passcode-based authentication system ensures only authorized users can retrieve the hidden message.

Features
âœ… Message Concealment â€“ Hide secret messages inside an image.
âœ… Passcode Protection â€“ Ensures only authorized users can decrypt the message.
âœ… Stealth Communication â€“ Image remains visually unchanged to avoid detection.
âœ… Simple & Efficient â€“ Lightweight and easy to use.
âœ… Cross-Platform Support â€“ Runs on any system with Python and OpenCV installed.

Technologies Used
Python â€“ Core language for implementation.
OpenCV â€“ Image processing and manipulation.
NumPy â€“ Efficient handling of pixel data.
OS Module â€“ File handling and system command execution.
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You also need to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy
Running the Program
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-steganography.git
cd image-steganography
Run the Program

bash
Copy
Edit
python stego.py
Follow On-Screen Instructions

Enter a secret message to hide.
Set a passcode for encryption.
An encrypted image will be generated.
To decrypt, enter the correct passcode when prompted.
Usage
Encryption (Hiding a Message)
The user inputs a secret message and passcode.
The message is encoded into the pixel values of the image.
The modified image is saved as encryptedImage.jpg.
Decryption (Retrieving the Message)
The user enters the passcode for authentication.
If correct, the hidden message is extracted from the image.
If incorrect, access is denied.
End Users
Journalists & Activists â€“ Secure communication in restricted areas.
Government & Intelligence Agencies â€“ Concealed transmission of sensitive data.
Cybersecurity Experts â€“ Research and implementation of data hiding techniques.
General Users â€“ Personal data security and privacy enhancement.
Limitations & Future Enhancements
ðŸš§ Limitations

The message size is limited by the image resolution.
The encryption method could be enhanced for better security.
ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Implement stronger encryption techniques.
Support for various image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.).
Enhance GUI for user-friendly interaction.
Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet effective solution for secure and undetectable communication. By embedding messages within images and using passcode protection, it ensures privacy and confidentiality. With potential applications in cybersecurity, intelligence, and personal data protection, this steganography system serves as a powerful tool for secure digital communication.
